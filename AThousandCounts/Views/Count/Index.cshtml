    At A Thousand Counts we are
    passionate about counting. That's why we are
    creating a video of 1000 counters counting to one thousand.
    You can be one! <br /><br />
    A counter gets assigned a number in the range 1-1000.<br />
    Every counter gets four seconds to count his or her assigned number 
    into her or his webcam with microphone enabled.<br /><br />
    Once 1000 videos are collected there will be no more numbers available.
    The A Thousand Counts team will then put your clips
    in sequence so that a video of approximately one hour will be created where
    counters from all over the world are counting to 1000!

    <br /><br />

    Join the movement and count!<br /><br />
    Count passionately. Count lively. Count clearly. Count expectantly.
    But, make sure to count.  <br /><br />
    Be quick and click the pink square. There are only <strong>@ViewBag.CountsLeft</strong> counts left on A Thousand Counts...
